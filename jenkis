[ artifact - build outcome if it a java file output file is jar for war file if it is a dotnet file .exe files]
Python, the build process is often managed using tools like 'setuptools' and 'pip'

1) what is jekins and how does it contribute to ci cd process ?
  Jenkins is an open-source automation server commonly used for building, testing, and deploying software. 
  It provide CI/CD process by automating variuos stages of software development.
  It is automation server, CI, CD, Extensibility through plugins, Monitoring and notifications

2) Explain the difference between a freestyle project and a pipeline project in Jenkins ?
  Freestyle project:
    we will configure our build or deployment process using a point-and-click web interface.
    Each project is a separate task. It is used for simple jobs, It is hard to easily share or reuse.
    It is hard to see the big picture of your entire process.

  Pipeline project:
    we need to write build and deployment steps.
    we can reuse the code for multiple projects.
    we can have a clear picture of entire process because we will write entire process at a single place.
    It is used for complex projects.
    we can have the option like, the build will automatically runs when there a change in repo.

3) How do you install jenkins? can you describe the initial setup steps?
  install java jdk
  install jenkins

4) what are jenkins pulgins, and how do you use/install them ?
  Jenkins plugins are extensions that add functionality to the Jenkins automation server. 
  Jenkins plugins can provide features such as source code management, build tools integration, deployment support, notification services, and more.
  Manage Jenkins > plugins > Available > Search > select >install with or without restart

5) How do you create a new job in jenkins? Walk me through the basic steps ?


6) Explain the purpose of Jenkinsfile. How is it used in Jenkins Pipeline ?
  A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline. 
  The Jenkinsfile is written using the Groovy scripting language and can be stored along with the 
  source code of your application in version control.
  
  It provides a clear and visual representation of your entire pipeline.

7) what is jenkins pipeline? can you provide an example of a simple jenkins pipeline script ?
  A Jenkins Pipeline is a set of instructions expressed in code that defines an automated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) process.

  pipeline {
    agent any 
    tools { nodejs 'nodejs' }
    stages {
      stage('Build') {
        steps {
          echo 'hi'
        }
      }
      stage('Test') {
        steps {
          echo 'hi'
        }
      }
      stage('Deploy') {
        steps {
          echo 'hi'
        }
      }
  }
}

8) How do you trigger a build in Jenkins manually, and how can builds be triggered automatically?
  In Jenkins, builds can be triggered both manually and automatically based on certain events. 

  Triggering a Build Manually:
    Open the Jenkins web interface and navigate to the job you want to build.
    On the job's homepage, you will typically find a "Build Now" or "Build" button. Click on this button to trigger a manual build.
  Triggering a Build Automatically:
    SCM Polling, Webhooks, Scheduled Builds, Git, GitHub, or GitLab, 
  there are plugins available that can trigger builds automatically when changes are pushed to the repository.

9) what is jenkins node, and how does it contribute to the build process ?
    A Jenkins node, also known as an agent or slave, is a separate machine, either physical or virtual, that extends the capabilities of the Jenkins automation server. 
    It is allowing the execution of build and deployment tasks on machines other than the Jenkins master.

    Parallel Execution: It allows jenkins to perform multiple tasks.
    Resource Distribution: By connecting multiple nodes to the Jenkins master, organizations can distribute workloads across different machines. 

10) describe the concept of downstream and upstream projects in jenkins ?
Upstream Project:
  An upstream project is a project that triggers another project's build. When an upstream project is built, 
  it may automatically trigger the build of its downstream projects.

Downstream Project:
  A downstream project is a project that is triggered by the successful completion of a build in an upstream project. 
  The downstream project depends on the artifacts or results produced by the upstream project.



11) How does jenkins integrate with version control systems like git?
  Jenkins integrates with version control systems (VCS), such as Git, through plugins. These plugins allow Jenkins to interact with the VCS, 
  retrieve source code, trigger builds based on code changes.

12) what is a jenkins webhook? How is it used in the context of version control integration?
  It is a mechanism that enables Jenkins to receive real-time notifications about events that occur in a version control system (VCS), such as Git.

13) Explain the concept of build artifcts. How are they managed in jenkins ?
  Build artifacts are the files and outputs generated during the build process.
  Build artifacts are essential for the deployment and distribution of software. 

    benefits:
      Reproducibility
      Traceability
      Dependency Management

14) How can jenkins be used for deployment? What are some deployment strategies in Jenkins ?
    Deployment in Jenkins refers to the automated and systematic process of releasing software applications or updates to different environments, 
  such as development, testing, staging, and production.

    Use a Jenkins job to execute deployment scripts.
    Integrate Jenkins with deployment tools such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet.
    Use Jenkins to integrate with container orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

15) How do you secure a Jenkins installation? What security features does Jenkins provide ?
    Access Control : Authentication, Authorization
    Project base security
    Credentials Management

16) What is jenkins pipeline as code (Jenkinsfile)? How does it benefit the CI/CD process?
    Jenkins Pipeline as Code, often represented by a file named Jenkinsfile, is a powerful feature that allows you to define and manage your Jenkins CI/CD processes as code. 

17) Can you describe how to parallize builds in jenkins pipeline?
    pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Parallel Tests') {
            // Define parallel branches for tests
            parallel {
                stage('Run Unit Tests') {
                    steps {
                        echo 'Running unit tests...'
                        // Add steps to run unit tests
                    }
                }
                stage('Run Integration Tests') {
                    steps {
                        echo 'Running integration tests...'
                        // Add steps to run integration tests
                    }
                }
                stage('Run E2E Tests') {
                    steps {
                        echo 'Running end-to-end tests...'
                        // Add steps to run end-to-end tests
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Post-Test Steps') {
            steps {
                echo 'Performing post-test steps...'
                // Add additional steps after parallel tests
            }
        }
    }
}


18) What is jenkins blueocean, and how does it enchance the jenkins user interface?
    Jenkins Blue Ocean is indeed a plugin for Jenkins
    Jenkins Blue Ocean is a modern user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) extension for Jenkins, designed to improve and simplify the way users interact with Jenkins pipelines and builds. 
    Blue Ocean provides a more visual, intuitive, and efficient interface for managing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. 

19) How do you trobleshoot a failed build in jenkins? What tools or techniques do you use?
  Troubleshooting a failed build in Jenkins involves identifying the root cause of the failure and addressing the issue.

  Build Console Output
  Pipeline Visualization (Blue Ocean)
  Build History and Trends
  View Changes
  Build Environment
  Dependency Management

20) Have you worked with any pulgins or integrations? Can you share your experienece


21) explain the concept of "quiet period" in jenkins and when it might be useful?
  the "quiet period" refers to a configurable delay or waiting period that occurs after a change is detected in the version control system (VCS) before a build is triggered. 
  During this quiet period, Jenkins waits to see if there are any additional changes. If additional changes are detected within the specified quiet period, 
  the build is triggered only once, incorporating all the changes that occurred during that time frame.
